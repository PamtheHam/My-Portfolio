        <p>My name is Pamela Hammond. I am a hard-working full-stack web developer with a passion for designing meaningful and creative websites. After working within technology in higher education, I developed an interest in programming and earned a certificate in full-stack web development from the Coding Bootcamp at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I consider myself both a Student Affairs Professional and a Web Developer, with experience working in student services within higher education and the full-stack of web development. An innovative and goal-oriented individual with excellent attention to detail and problem-solving skills, I am dedicated to building original and efficient web applications from start to finish with proficient skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My passion lies in web design and accessibility, looking for the perfect match with a company that will test and further my knowledge of web development. </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my professional roles, I enjoy traveling and exploring all the world has to offer. I have spent time in Mexico, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, France, Greece, and South Korea, and I plan to travel so much more. My future travel plans include walking el Camino de Santiago in Spain, visiting the high mountains of Machu Picchu in Peru, and camping in the Upper Svaneti of Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy spending time with my husband Chris, my long-haired chihuahua Rafa, and my chartreux cat Pusheen. In my free time, I solve jigsaw puzzles, go to the beach, and experiment with new makeup styles and techniques.</p>
