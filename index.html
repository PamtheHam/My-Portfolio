      <!-- re-write this about me to be more current-->
       <p> 
        I discovered my passion for student affairs while working as a Resident Assistant. I served in the role of Resident Assistant for two years before I graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in Sociology at Fort Hays State University, where I am currently working towards a Masters of Science in Education with a concentration in Higher Education Student Affairs. I am a hardworking professional who has worked in student activities and international student services. I enjoy being physically active and spending time with my husband in nice weather.
