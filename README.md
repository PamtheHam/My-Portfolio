# My-Portfolio
This webpage is dedicated to all of my most valued work and is a reflection of my unique personality and talents.
I styled the page using CSS pseudo-classes, media querys, and flexboxes. I included links to my personal social media accounts including Github, Instagram, and LinkedIn. 

Here is the url of my site deployed:
